This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with certain Android devices.  The camera preview might freeze or fail to initialize, resulting in a blank screen or an error message. This isn't consistent across all devices, making debugging difficult. The issue seems linked to specific hardware configurations or Android versions, but pinpointing the exact cause has proven challenging.
